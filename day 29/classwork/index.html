    <p4><br>nika is years old. A boy who can do more than what he is now
        . He doesn't know what he can do yet, but I'm sure 
        if he wants to, he'll be better than what he is now.</p4>

        Nyako is 9 years old and is the smallest squad in our small family (squad).
         He is very cute and smart. He has great progress in the future and
          I think he will be able to do it all.

        Anri Nakashdze, 15 years old, he just arrived in Goa and 
        I think he has a great future ahead of him. He knows a lot about computers and 
        he knows English well, and I think that programming won't cut it for him.
